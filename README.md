# Equal-weighted-S-P-500
This is a python code that outputs how many stocks you should buy of each of the companies listed in the S&P 500 so that you ivest equal amounts in them 
you may notice I stop at only 5 stocks this is because the free version of the API i am using has a limit of 5 requests per miinute this code could easily be scaled up if need be
this was a lot of fun for me learning about API requests and documentation and how to work with pandas in python
